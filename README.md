Project Overview: Predicting Company Bankruptcies
📌 Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt based on financial indicators, operational metrics, and risk factors. This enables early warning systems for investors, banks, and regulatory bodies to minimize financial risks.

🔍 Problem Statement:
Company bankruptcies can lead to significant financial losses for stakeholders. Early prediction of bankruptcy allows companies, lenders, and investors to make informed decisions, restructure operations, or avoid high-risk investments.

📊 Dataset Overview:
The dataset typically contains financial and operational attributes such as:

Financial Ratios (e.g., debt ratio, working capital, retained earnings)

Profitability Metrics (e.g., net profit margin, operating margin)

Liquidity Ratios (e.g., current ratio, quick ratio)

Operational Efficiency (e.g., asset turnover, sales growth)

Target Variable:

0 → Company is not bankrupt

1 → Company is bankrupt

🔬 Key Areas of Analysis:
1️⃣ Financial health indicators that highly correlate with bankruptcy.
2️⃣ Liquidity and debt analysis to assess the company’s ability to meet obligations.
3️⃣ Profitability trends over time as a warning sign of financial distress.
4️⃣ Operational efficiency measures predicting long-term sustainability.

🛠 Methodology:
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand patterns, distributions, and key financial warning signs.
✅ Feature Engineering: Scale numerical features, handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.
✅ Model Selection: Train and compare Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
✅ Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using GridSearchCV.
✅ Model Evaluation: Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC Curve, with special focus on Recall (important to minimize false negatives).

🎯 Project Impact:
🚀 Risk Mitigation – Enable investors and banks to spot potential bankruptcies early.
📊 Better Decision-Making – Help companies take preventive measures before financial collapse.
🎯 Financial Stability – Support more resilient financial markets by reducing exposure to high-risk entities.

📝 Conclusion:
This project uses machine learning to build an early warning system for predicting company bankruptcies. The insights help in risk assessment, investment strategy, and corporate governance, strengthening financial resilience in markets.
